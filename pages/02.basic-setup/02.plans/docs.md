Plans are the central of the system. That's what you sell to your customers. You setup subscription plans, then customers browse your site, see these plans and subscribe to the plan he/she wants, process payment... to become an active subscriber in the system.

Base on the **price** of subscription plans, Membership Pro supports the following subscription plans type

1. **Free subscription plans**
2. **Onetime payment subscription plans**
3. **Recurring Subscription plans**
4. **Recurring Subscription plans with trial duration** (can be free trial)

Base on the **subscription length**, we can devide subscription plans into the two types below:

1. **Fixed subscription length** (for example **15 days**, **1 month**, **3 months**, **1 year**). For this type of subscription plans, when subscribers sign up, their subscription will be expired after the subscription length you defined for the plan.
2. **Fixed Expiration Date**. For this type of subscription plans, when subscribers sign up, their subscriptions will be expired at a fixed date (for example 31 December 2016), not depend on the date they sign up. Of course the extension is smart enough so that if users sign up after that fixed date, their expiration date will be changed to next year. For example, if you set **Expiration Date** of the plan to **31 Decemmber 2015** and users sign up at **sometime in 2016**, their subscription will be expired on **31 December 2016**. So in this case, you won't have to change setting of the plan every year.

To access to categories management page, there are 3 different ways:
1. Access to **Components => Membership Pro => Subscription Plans**.
2. Access to Membership Pro Dashboard, then click on Plans icon
3. On any pages in Membership Pro, access to **Setup => Plans**

### Renew Options
If you enable renewal for the subscription plan, subscribers can renew their membership to be remain as an active subscriber in the system:
1. If you don't setup any renew options, when subscribers renew their membership for the plan, he will have to pay the same price with the price of the subscription plan and their membership will be extended X days / Weeks / Months / Years (with X is subscritption length of the plan)
2. If you setup renew options, subscribers can choose the best renew option they want to renew their membership. Each renew option will have different price and will extend subscribers membership to a certain date (less time, less price, more time, more price). For example, if you have a subscription plan with subscription length 3 months and price 60$, you can create different renew options like that to give more renew options to your subscribers:
* Renew membership for 1 month, the price will be 20$
* Renew membership for 2 months, the price will be 36$ (the pricec is abit less to ecourage subscribers renew longer)
* Renew membership for 4 months, the price will be 70$... and so on

### Upgrade Options
You might want to give users the option to **upgrade** their membership from a subscription plan with **lower prority** (access to less resources in less time) to other subscription plan with higher priority (access to more resources in a longer time). For example, upgrade from **3 Months Memebership** to **6 Months Memebership** or **12 Months Memebership**. In this case, you can add upgrade options when you add / edit subscrition plan as you see in this screenshot:

To add upgrade options, in add / edit subscription plan plage, look at **Upgrade Options** section, press **Add** button add new upgrade option, select the plan which subscribers of this plan can upgrade their membership to and enter the price of the upgrade.
